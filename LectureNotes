L1-2
1. Variable names cannot begin with numbers
2. println has built in "\n" at the end of string

public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

3. javac HelloWorld.java  this one has ".java" in the end
    java HelloWorld     this one specify java at the beginning
4. Scanner:
    import java.util.Scanner;   first remeber java.util.scanner

    public class Echo {
        public static void main (String[] args) {
                Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in)  Here it is "System.in"
                System.out.println("Please enter a word");
                String word = keyboard.next();    To get a word, use Variable.next() function
                int n = keyboard.nextInt();       To get a number, use Varible.nextInt()
                System.out.println("You entered the word " + word + " and the number "+ n);
            }
    }

L3-4
0. Math.pow(number,power): to raise a power.
    Math.PI: 3.1415926....


1. Primitive types: like int char double...They use a fixed amount of memory.
They can be changed with simple math operations like +-*%
    Objects are customized type of variables like String. One object can contain many primitive type of
    as well as many other objects.
2. If the variables are declared in BRACES, it ONLY exists within the braces
But the change made on the variables outside the braces will be kept.

int x = 3;
{
    int y = 5; // y is declared here , but z does not exist yet
    int z = y; // y is still fine , and z is now declared too
    x = y; // we 'll copy the value of y into x
 }
// y is no longer defined : it is out of scope
// x now has the value 5

3. types: primitive + reference
4. The primitive types ,boolean and char are inclusive, are reserved words, but
String is not reserved. You can use it as a variable name or to make your own type but it is very risky!

5. The initial value of boolean type is false. You can use & | operations.
6. char type is with single quotes like char ch = 'A'
7. Java does not have unsigned data type.
